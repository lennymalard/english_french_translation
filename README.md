QUICK README
------------

TrED (Translation Encoder-Decoder) Models were built to explore sequence-to-sequence translation tasks.


TrED1 is an LSTM Encoder-Decoder

TrED2 is a BiLSTM Encoder-Decoder

TrED3 is a BiLSTM Encoder-Decoder with Attention 

TrED4 is a Transformer Encoder-Decoder (currently in development)


Evaluation results (TBA) :

The evaluation process combines BLEU and METEOR metrics. TrED2 is currently the best option for translating individual sentences.


More information is coming soon.
